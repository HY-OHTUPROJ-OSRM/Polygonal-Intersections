# Polygonal Intersection Algorithms

This repository contains an algorithm that finds the intersections between a polygonal chain and a polygon, as well as a graphical test app for it (currently only for Windows).

### To do
* An algorithm to determine if the starting point of the chain is inside the polygon.
* Check if a segment of the chain intersects with an edge the polygon that's collinear with it.
